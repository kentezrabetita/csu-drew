# Drew

Drew is a website directory of Links and Resources for Caraga State University.

## Why drew?

Drew is a name of a dog I sometimes encounter in the campus. He is a good dog. Really.

## Why create this website?

I find it annoying that sometimes I have to click a lot of unnecessary links on the CSU Website just to go to a specific url. They should update the site, really.

## Roadmap

- [ ] update about page
- [ ] update contact page
- [ ] add more links
